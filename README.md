This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Python related to division by zero. The function `function_with_uncommon_bug` handles the case where either `a` or `b` is zero correctly, returning the other number. However, when both `a` and `b` are zero, it unexpectedly returns 0 instead of raising a `ZeroDivisionError`.  The solution file provides a corrected version.
